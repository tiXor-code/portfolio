# A Digital Journey - Portfolio for Teodor-Cristian Luțoiu

This is an interactive, cinematic portfolio website that takes the user on a journey through space to explore the work of Teodor-Cristian Luțoiu. The project is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library for high-performance animations.

## Current Progress & Implemented Features

The project has been built with a specific vision in mind, drawing inspiration from the polished, story-driven animations of Apple's product pages and the immersive, layered environments of sites like "The Goonies."

- **Cinematic Launch Sequence:** The user experience begins on Earth. As the user scrolls, a rocket launches, and the view transitions seamlessly from an Earth-orbit backdrop to a deep-space nebula.
- **GSAP-Powered Animations:** The entire scrolling experience is controlled by GSAP and its `ScrollTrigger` plugin, ensuring fluid, high-performance animations.
- **Multi-Layered Parallax:** The background is composed of multiple layers (Earth, a nebula, and a starfield) that move at different speeds, creating a convincing illusion of depth.
- **Pinned Content Sections:** The "Selected Works" section uses a pinning effect. As the user scrolls, the section locks in place while the project cards animate into view, creating a focused showcase.
- **Elegant & Modern UI:** The user interface is designed to be clean, minimalist, and sophisticated, with a dark theme and subtle "glassmorphism" effects on UI elements.

## Asset Replacement Guide

The project currently uses placeholder images. To complete the visual design, you need to download the following assets and place them in the `public/images/` directory, replacing the existing files.
